iOS for the .Net Web Guy

How many of you are currently working as .Net Web Programmers?

What this talk isn't.
	Not trying to convince you to do iOS
	Not trying to TEACH you iOS
	
What this talk is.
	Overview of iPhone Development for .Net Web Programmers
	Geared toward .Net Web devs who have been intimidated by XCode, iOS or Objective-C
	A quick summary of the things I have learned over the last year

Why should I care about iOS?
	Mobile development is where Web development was in the mid-to-late nineties
	Easiest time to break into (Native) Mobile development
	iOS seems to be the one businesses reach for first

XCode
	Demo - (10 Minutes or less)
		Navigators
		Inspectors
		Headers
		Implementation

	The Good
		Loads pretty fast
		Git Integration
		Excellent Intellisense
		Keyboard shortcuts for most things
		Help Integration (with code samples!)

	Annoyances
		Kitchen-Sink UI
		Marking XIB files modified on select

	Vs. VS
		Workspaces & Projects == Solutions & Projects
		No ReSharper

Objective-C
	What is it?
	How is it different/same as C?
		Extra libraries on top of C

	How does it compare to C#?
		obj-c is very low-level
			has required me to learn some of the CS stuff I never learned
		EVERYTHING on the heap (for the most part)
		EVERYTHING is a pointer (for the most part)
		JUST got garbage collection (of sorts)
		can be very wordy (I think is a PLUS)
		in some places is not wordy at all "+" vs c# "static"
			Symbols kill readability (until you get used to them)
iOS
	What is it?
		Operating System (duh!)
		Libraries/Frameworks (NextStep)
			Foundation.framework
			UIKit.framework
			CoreGraphic.framework
	Familiar
		constructors ( [[id alloc] init] )

Interface Builder
	Drag & drop you don't have to be afraid of
	control drag to write code ;)
	IBOutlets & IBActions (IBForgettin)

App Store
	Apple goes out of their way to make this hard (I think).
	Certificate Signing Request
	Get certificate
	Import into the keychain
	Build and sign with *.p12 (combination of public/private key)
	Using Provisioning Profile
	Akin to Github public key
	Initial submission (taking about 6 business days currently)
	Update submission (takes about 4 days)

CocoaPods
	How it works
		Create Podfile
	How is it is same/different from NuGet
	Sample (regular pods)
		Kiwi
		AFNetworking

Testing
	Unit Tesing
		OCUnit
			Good & Bad
			Compares to NUnit
		Kiwi
			Good & Bad
			Compares to MSpec
	Automated UI Testing
		Cucumber
		Frank

Continuous Integration
	Jenkins
	Test Flight
	Ruby/Rake
		Shenzhen
		Cupertino
	
Education
	NSScreencasts
	Peepcode
	Tekpub
	Books
		Big Nerd Ranch
		Unit Testing with Kiwi
